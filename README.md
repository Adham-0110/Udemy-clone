ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Udemy Clone Webpage ðŸš€
I'm excited to share a project I've recently worked on â€” a Udemy Clone built with HTML and CSS Flexbox!
In this project, I recreated a responsive and modern version of the Udemy homepage. Using Flexbox for layout design, I was able to ensure the webpage adapts seamlessly across devices, from desktop to mobile. This project helped me refine my skills in responsive web design, CSS Flexbox, and UI/UX principles.
Key features of the Udemy Clone: ðŸ”¹ Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
 ðŸ”¹ Flexbox-based design for flexible and dynamic components
 ðŸ”¹ A visually clean and professional homepage that mimics the Udemy interface
This is a great example of how Flexbox can be used to create fluid layouts without relying on complex CSS techniques. It was a fun and rewarding challenge to replicate a well-known platform's look and feel using just HTML and CSS!
Check out the video for a walkthrough of the project! ðŸŽ¥
